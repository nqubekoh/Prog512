Dear all, Please note:

1.Please be informed that the assignment due dates have been extended to 30th August 2019

2.I have uploaded CA test 1 timetable

3.since we are only left with one week of lectures before your CA test 1, we cant be able to go over everything in class. So i kindly ask everyone of you to please go through Topic 1 up to 3(Scope for test 1) on their own so that when we meet in class i'll take questions that you might have and give you a small class test to prepare you for CATest which is Next week ..Thanks..
